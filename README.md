# Linux Tools
Some random tools and scripts useful for using my Debian server called [messier](https://github.com/AveoCross/messier).

### Contents:
* download.sh - Shell script for mass downloading images/videos/gifs and general files onto your disk. It can also download the whole website. **WGET** and **ZIP** packages are needed for this script.  **SRCFIL** is a filename of exported HTML from Chrome Bookmark Manager and it must be placed into SRCDIR directory. **SRCDIR** is a directory which will be zipped. The script itself can be placed anywhere.
