# Linux Tools
Some random tools and scripts useful for using my Debian server called [messier](https://github.com/AveoCross/messier).

### Contents:
* download.sh - Shell script for mass downloading images/videos/gifs and generally files into your disk. It can also download whole website. **WGET** and **ZIP** packages are needed for this script.  **SRCFIL** is a filename of exported HTML from Chrome Bookmark Manager. **SRCDIR** is a directory which will be zipped.
